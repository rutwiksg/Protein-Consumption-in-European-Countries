### Report on Protein Consumption in European Countries

#### Introduction

This report presents an analysis of the average protein consumption patterns across 25 European countries. The analysis was conducted using multivariate statistical techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Cluster Analysis, to explore dietary similarities and differences. The key focus was on examining how different countries are grouped based on their protein sources, which include meat, dairy, grains, and other food categories. The dataset analyzed provided daily protein consumption (in grams per person) from various food sources for each country.

#### Data Overview

The dataset comprises estimates of protein consumption per person per day across different European countries, broken down by food source. These sources include:

- Red Meat
- White Meat
- Eggs
- Milk
- Fish
- Cereals
- Starchy Foods
- Pulses, Nuts, and Oilseeds
- Fruits and Vegetables

This dataset aims to capture the dietary habits and trends across these countries, identifying key factors that influence food choices, including cultural, geographic, and economic considerations.

#### Analysis

##### 1. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to reduce the complexity of the dataset by identifying the most significant variables contributing to the overall variance. The PCA revealed the following:

- **Two principal components** account for 86.8% of the total variance.
- The first principal component (PC1) explains 69.98% of the variance, while the second principal component (PC2) accounts for 16.79%.
- A biplot representation of the PCA shows that meat and dairy are strongly correlated, and cereals are more distinct.

From the PCA, countries with similar dietary patterns were grouped together, such as:
- Southern European countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece) that focus more on fruits, vegetables, pulses, and oilseeds.
- Balkan countries (Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia) that primarily consume cereals.
- Northern and Western European countries that rely heavily on dairy and meat.

##### 2. Cluster Analysis

Cluster Analysis further categorized the countries into groups based on similarities in their protein consumption patterns. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be two using methods like the silhouette method and the gap statistic.

The two main clusters identified are:
1. **Cluster 1**: Includes Northern, Western, and Eastern European countries, where dairy and meat consumption is more prevalent.
2. **Cluster 2**: Contains Southern European and Balkan countries, where the diet is more balanced between cereals, fruits, vegetables, and oilseeds.

##### 3. Observations by Region

The analysis identified four distinct regions with specific dietary characteristics:

- **Balkan Countries (Albania, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria)**: Protein intake is largely derived from cereals. This is influenced by geographic factors, with these countries having a tradition of wheat-based diets.

- **Southern European Countries (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece)**: These countries have a Mediterranean diet, which is rich in seafood, fruits, vegetables, pulses, and olive oil. Their primary protein sources are fruits, vegetables, and legumes.

- **Eastern European Countries (USSR, Hungary, Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia)**: The diet is characterized by high meat and dairy consumption, influenced by Soviet-era food policies that emphasized meat and grains.

- **Western and Northern European Countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, UK, West Germany)**: These countries have a diverse protein diet with an emphasis on dairy products and various meats, especially beef, pork, and poultry.

#### Conclusion

The analysis of protein consumption in European countries revealed clear regional dietary patterns influenced by geographic, cultural, and historical factors. Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis both highlighted significant differences between Northern/Western European diets (high in meat and dairy) and Southern/Balkan diets (high in fruits, vegetables, and cereals). These findings are valuable for understanding dietary trends and potential health implications across different European regions.

The clustering and PCA analysis indicate that cultural and economic factors strongly shape dietary habits, with countries in closer geographic proximity often sharing more similar consumption patterns.
